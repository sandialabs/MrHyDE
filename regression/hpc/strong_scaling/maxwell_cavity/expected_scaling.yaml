# Expected Scaling Behavior for Maxwell Cavity Strong Scaling Test
#
# This file documents qualitative expectations for the strong scaling test.
# These are NOT hard thresholds - they provide guidance on what "reasonable"
# scaling looks like for this problem.

# Minimum parallel efficiency threshold (percent)
# The test will FAIL if efficiency drops below this value.
# This is intentionally set low to accommodate various hardware configurations.
minimum_parallel_efficiency: 50

# Problem characteristics
problem:
  type: "Maxwell 3D cavity (TM_110 mode)"
  mesh_size: "20x20x10 hexahedral elements (4000 total)"
  solver: "Iterative with domain decomposition preconditioner"
  time_steps: 20

# Expected behavior notes
notes: |
  Strong scaling efficiency depends heavily on:
  
  1. Problem Size:
     - Small problems have less parallel work, leading to lower efficiency
     - This test uses 4000 elements which is modest; efficiency may be lower
       than production-scale runs
  
  2. Hardware Configuration:
     - Shared-memory systems typically show 70-90% efficiency at low core counts
     - Distributed memory systems may show lower efficiency due to communication
     - NUMA effects can reduce efficiency on multi-socket nodes
  
  3. Solver Characteristics:
     - Iterative solvers with domain decomposition depend on subdomain coupling
     - Communication overhead increases with processor count
     - Preconditioner setup cost may not scale perfectly
  
  4. What to expect:
     - 1 to 2 procs: 80-95% efficiency (minimal communication)
     - 2 to 4 procs: 60-85% efficiency (increasing communication)
     - Above 4 procs: efficiency depends strongly on problem size
  
  If this test fails:
     - First check if the run completed successfully
     - Review timing breakdown to identify bottlenecks
     - Consider if hardware issues (oversubscription, memory pressure) affected results
     - For unusual failures, run manually and inspect log files
